Shin splint. This is pain that happens in the front or inside of the lower leg along the shin bone (tibia). Shin splints (also called medial tibial stress syndrome or MTSS) are common after changing your workout, such as running longer distances or increasing the number of days you run, too quickly. Painwise, they can be hard to distinguish from a stress fracture of the shin, but the pain is usually more spread out along the bone. Also, an xray is normal to determine which you have.
Shin splints refer to pain and tenderness along or just behind the large bone in the lower leg (the tibia). Shin splints most often happen after hard exercise, sports, or repetitive activity. This repetitive action can lead to inflammation of the muscles, tendons, and thin layer of tissue covering the shin bones, causing pain. These are the most common symptoms of shin splints: Pain felt on the front and outside of the shin. It's first felt when the heel touches the ground during running. In time, pain becomes constant and the shin is painful to the touch; Pain that starts on the inside of the lower leg above the ankle. Pain gets worse when standing on the toes or rolling the ankle inward. As the shin splint progresses, the pain will increase. The symptoms of shin splints may look like other conditions or medical problems. Always talk with your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. The best course of treatment for shin splints is to stop any activity that's causing the pain until the injury is healed. Other treatment may include: Stretching exercises, Strengthening exercises, Cold packs, Medicine, such as ibuprofen, Running shoes with a stiff heel and special arch support. You may be able to prevent shin splints by wearing good fitting athletic shoes. Also, gradually increase the intensity, duration, and frequency of a new exercise routine. It may also help to switch between high impact activities and low impact activities such as swimming or cycling. (Johns Hopkins Medicine)
